/**
 * One shared entitlements refresh, used by every caller that needs server plan
 * state applied to the store.
 *
 * Lifted out of `(tabs)/_layout.tsx` in #173. It used to be a private function
 * there with the hourly throttle baked in, which was fine while the app owned
 * the purchase flow — the plan could only change from inside the app, so the
 * app already knew. Now that subscribing, upgrading and cancelling all happen
 * on the web, a user can return from the browser on a different plan than they
 * left on, and waiting up to an hour to notice would look like the payment
 * didn't work. Hence `force`.
