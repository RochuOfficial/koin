/**
 * Primary account authentication — Appwrite Email OTP (passwordless).
 *
 * This is LAYER 1 of the auth design (see the plan): it establishes the real
 * account identity and a session. It is deliberately separate from the device
 * PIN (layer 3), which only locks/unlocks access to the session secret locally.
 *
 * Flow:
 *   1. requestEmailOtp(email)  -> Appwrite emails a one-time code, returns userId
 *   2. verifyEmailOtp(userId, code) -> creates a session, returns its secret
 *   3. the caller persists the secret encrypted behind the PIN (see pin.ts)
 *
 * NOTE: the emailed OTP is NOT the device PIN. UI copy must keep them distinct.
 *
 * Env:
 *   EXPO_PUBLIC_REVIEWER_DEMO_EMAILS  optional, comma-separated allowlist of
 *     App Store/Play reviewer demo emails that sign in with a static password
 *     instead of Email OTP (see isReviewerDemoEmail below and LoginGate.tsx).
 *     Unset/empty means the feature is entirely inert.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — session secret is never in the SDK's response body: Appwrite
 * deliberately omits it (sessions are meant to live in cookies — confirmed
 * upstream, https://github.com/appwrite/appwrite/issues/8673). It's only
 * recoverable via the `X-Fallback-Cookies` mechanism, which react-native-appwrite
 * only implements for web (`window.localStorage`) and silently no-ops on native.
 * So we read the real secret ourselves from the native cookie jar (the same
 * value Appwrite also sets as a Set-Cookie) right after the session call, then
 * wipe the cookie so the only place it lives is our own PIN-encrypted storage.
